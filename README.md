## Psycholinguistic features for emotion intensity prediction in tweets

Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) is a rich dictionary that map words into several psychological categories such as Affective, Social, Cognitive, Perceptual and Biological processes. In this work, we have used LIWC psycholinguistic categories to train regression models and predict emotion intensity in tweets for the EmoInt-2017 task. Results show that LIWC features may boost emotion intensity prediction on the basis of a low dimension set.
